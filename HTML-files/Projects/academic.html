                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>The classical description of black holes in general relativity portrays them as regions of spacetime where a singularity is enclosed by an event horizon, beyond which no information can escape. On the other hand, the fuzzball paradigm in string theory presents a distinct perspective, depicting black holes as highly excited string states that lack a normal event horizon. The gravitational wave signals from compact object mergers are analysed to examine the observational significance of the fuzzball theory. The methodology involves the systematic comparison between standard black hole merger waveforms and specific waveform deviations predicted by fuzzball models, focusing on identifying distinct signatures in phase evolution and ringdown characteristics. Bayesian inference and machine learning techniques are employed to extract potential deviations from classical predictions. Current gravitational wave detectors (LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA) help analyse the data and evaluate how next-generation observatories might detect quantum gravity effects in extreme gravitational environments. The results define measurable limits on the differences between classical and string-based descriptions of black holes, offering empirical constraints on quantum gravity models. This work bridges theoretical predictions with observational limitations, offering a novel framework to determine fundamental aspects of black hole physics and potentially resolve longstanding questions about information preservation in black hole systems.</p>

                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>Galactic bars are essential dynamical structures that significantly influence the secular evolution of disk galaxies. Their genesis is influenced by gravitational instabilities, whereas their long-term evolution is regulated by the transfer of angular momentum among the stellar disk, dark matter halo, and central bulge. This research utilizes a mathematical and computational framework to examine the dynamic mechanisms underlying bar generation and evolution. The stability criteria for bar growth are analyzed using perturbation theory, resonance analysis, and numerical simulations derived from the collision-less Boltzmann equation and N-body methods. Significant emphasis is placed on the function of resonant angular momentum redistribution, encompassing co-rotation and Lindblad resonances, in governing bar strength and duration. The findings determine the impact of bars on galactic morphology, star formation, and central activity, enhancing the comprehension of secular galaxy evolution.</p>

                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                        <p>Investigating the composition of initial cosmic rays is essential for comprehending the characteristics of high-energy cosmic phenomena and their astrophysical origins. Determining the predominant particle types such as protons, helium, and iron nuclei yields insights regarding cosmic accelerators and the fundamental physics that dictate their interactions with the interstellar medium. Traditional classification approaches rely on physics-based models and empirical parameterizations. However, issues such as noise, atmospheric disturbances, and lack of sufficient data often restrict the effectiveness of these methods. This study investigates the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in order to classify primary cosmic rays based on key features such as energy, arrival direction, and shower particle statistics. Models like XGBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and TabTransformer's performance are assessed using empirical cosmic ray event data obtained from extensive air shower (EAS) measurements. The assessment results in the enhancement of the classification accuracy of the machine learning models significantly, with XGBoost achieving an accuracy of 94.57%. These findings do emphasise the potential of the AI-driven approaches in advancing high-energy astrophysics by improving the cosmic ray composition analysis and enabling more precise identification of their sources.</p>

                        <p>With the increasing feasibility of deep space exploration, interstellar travel has become a critical area of investigation within astrophysics and aerospace engineering. This paper examines the pivotal role of relativistic physics, specifically time dilation and relativistic energy demands, in missions approaching a significant fraction of the speed of light. Leveraging Einstein’s Special Relativity, we explore the implications of time dilation on astronauts’ aging, communication, and mission logistics, with a detailed analysis of the extraordinary energy requirements needed to sustain such speeds. Through comparative studies of propulsion technologies, including antimatter propulsion, warp drives, and ion propulsion, this research evaluates each method’s potential to achieve and maintain relativistic velocities, weighing propulsion efficiency against the massive energy challenges. Computational models and simulations further quantify the dual influence of time dilation and relativistic energy demands, offering insights critical to future mission design, human factors, and interstellar logistics. Our findings highlight a roadmap for the development of propulsion systems that balance near-light-speed travel feasibility with astronaut safety and mission sustainability, setting foundational benchmarks for the future of interstellar exploration.</p>
